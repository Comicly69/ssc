# SSC (Secure Site Certificate)

SSC (Secure Site Certificate) is a digital certificate issued to reputable websites and individuals who apply for one. This certificate is designed to provide assurance to website visitors that the site they are visiting is legitimate and secure.

## Why is SSC important?

In today's digital world, online security is a growing concern for many people. Cybercriminals are constantly on the lookout for vulnerabilities in websites to exploit for their own gain. The SSC is important because it provides a level of assurance to website visitors that the site they are visiting is secure and has been verified by a trusted third-party.

## How does SSC work?

When a website applies for an SSC, they undergo a rigorous verification process to ensure that they meet the standards set by us. This verification process may include checks on the website owner's identity, business registration, and other security-related details.

Once a website has been verified, the SSC is issued, and it can be displayed on the website. Website visitors can then click on the SSC to view information about the certificate and to verify that it is valid.

- Increased trust: Displaying an SSC on your website can increase the trust that visitors have in your site.
- Improved security: The verification process for an SSC can help to identify and address any security vulnerabilities on your website.
